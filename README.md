## Raspberry Pi 5, Bookworm and RealVNC Connect

https://help.realvnc.com/hc/en-us/articles/14110635000221-Raspberry-Pi-5-Bookworm-and-RealVNC-Connect#statement-0-0

* Our current versions of RealVNC Viewer and RealVNC Server unfortunately will not support the RPi 5 platform out-of-the-box as a result of Raspberry Piâ€™s move to a default Wayland environment on Debian (Bookworm).

#### Updates

2025-01-03 - Wayland support update
* Our development team are continuing to work on updating RealVNC Server for PiOS to support Wayland, we will share further updates as this progresses.

2023-10-12 - Pi OS Bookworm compatibility
* We can confirm compatibility of RealVNC Viewer and RealVNC Server when running Pi OS Bookworm in X11 mode, instead of Wayland (wayfire), as below.
* Raspberry Pi 0-3: These continue to use X11 by default therefore RealVNC Connect continues to be supported.
* Raspberry Pi 4-5: This device defaults to using Wayland (wayfire) on Pi OS Bookworm, however it is possible to switch to X11 by using the command line raspi-config utility, under Advanced Options -> Wayland, to use RealVNC Connect.
